No assumption is made with regards to the details of the numbering such as the presence of a year 0, or the possibility of years numbered negatively.
Any year numbering system can be an instance of this class even if the year definition doesn't exactly match the year definition of the Gregorian calendar.

This specification doesn't say anything about the general year being a year of the gregorian calendar, so you can use this era with other types of years.
For example, a date in the Chinese calendar may be given using a year indicated in the Common Era, even though the Chinese year starts and ends after the corresponding year in the Gregorian calendar.
This means that

The difference with time:generalDay is an optional suffix at the end, in the form of one letter, which can be:
- 'f' to represent the first day of a leap day
- 's' to represent the second day of a leap day
- 'o' to represent an omitted day (and thus an invalid date)

For instance, in a the case of a month where the calendar days go 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 6, etc. (which is possible in most luni-solar calendars), the days can be represented as: 
"---01"^^:generalDay
"---02"^^:generalDayL
"---03f"^^:generalDayL
"---03s"^^:generalDayL
"---04"^^:generalDayL
"---06"^^:generalDayL

The value-space is not defined, so a generic OWL2 processor cannot compute ordering relationships of values of this type.
The suffix is not mandatory even in the case of a leap day, so in our example, "---03"^^:generalDayL is valid but its meaning is ambiguous. 
This allows the representation of dates found in historical documents where such ambiguity is present."""@en ;
